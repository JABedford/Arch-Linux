# My Arch Linux Config
A dump for all steps/processes and files for my set up of Arch Linux on a VM.

Feel free to follow along for your own personal use, but please be aware I am a novice in regards to Linux and this is very much a learning experience for me so not everything will necessarily be the "correct" way of doing things.
